# Install xserver build dependencies on OpenIndiana (illumos), via IPS (`pkg`).
#
# OpenIndiana (unlike server-only OmniOS) is a desktop-capable illumos distro
# and packages the full X stack — every X library, the protocol headers, Mesa
# and the xcb-util family — under the single `openindiana.org` publisher in the
# standard /usr layout. So everything is installable; nothing has to be built
# from source here, and GLX can stay enabled (Mesa is packaged).
#
# FMRIs verified against the OpenIndiana Hipster catalog.

# Build toolchain — MUST succeed. `pkg install` is transactional, so a single
# unknown/ambiguous FMRI aborts the whole set; keeping this its own step
# *without* `|| true` makes a bad FMRI fail loudly (and named) instead of
# silently leaving us without a compiler/meson.

# Runtime + X libraries the server links against. Install them in ONE IPS
# transaction so the publisher parallelizes the downloads — the old per-package
# loop was 29 serial network round-trips. FMRIs are verified against the
# Hipster catalog, so the batch normally succeeds; on a rare failure we fall
# back to a best-effort per-package install so one misnamed FMRI can't abort
# the whole set (meson still flags anything genuinely required and absent).
